**Types**
A word type is the form or spelling of the characters, special characters or word independently of its specific occurrences in a textâ€”that is, the [[types]] considered as a *unique item* of [[vocabulary]].
Because *unique item* of [[vocabulary]] will include punctuation symbols, or special character like: ?, /, ~, &,.. so we will call [[types]] instead of [[word types]]
