#### Mechanical wave
- Mechanical wave is wave that obcillation that travels through space
- The energy travels from one point to another, and make the medium(air) deformed.
- Air molecules tend to bump to each other and make change in atmospheric pressure, create compression and rarefaction. 
- We can visualize the sound wave as line.
