### Sound Power
### Sound Power and Sound Intensity
#### Sound Power
*Sound power* or _acoustic power_ is the rate at which _sound energy_ is emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time
- Rate at which energy is transferred
- Energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions
- Measured in Watt - $W$
The sound power of Thunder is 1 Watt, need 100W to power a bublight.
#### Sound Intensity
*Sound intensity*, also known as *acoustic intensity*, is defined as the power carried by sound waves per unit area in a direction perpendicular to that area
- Sound power per unit aera
- Measured in $W/m^2$
### Intensity level
- Logarithmic scale
- Measured in [[Decibel]] ($dB$)
- Ration between two intensity values
- Use an intensity of reference ([[Threshold of hearing|TOH]])
