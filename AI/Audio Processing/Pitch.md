#Sound 
Is the conpect of we use for **perception** and **perceive** of [[Frequency]]. We hear frequency in logarithmic way. 2 frequency are perceived simlilarly if they differ by a **power of 2**.
Read [[Midi notes]] 
If we plot [[Pitch]] and [[Frequency]] we have this chart. Example with Midi note A4

#### Mapping pitch to frequency:
$$F(p)=2^{\frac{p-69}{12}}.440$$
with $p$ is the pitch we want to map

$$F(p+1)/F(p)=2^{1/12}=1.059$$
The ratio between 2 subsequent semitones always remains the same.
