### complex sound
- complex sound Superposition of sinusoids
- A parital is a sinusoid used to describe a sound
- The lowest partial is called *fundamental [[frequency]]*
- A harmonic partial is a frequency that's a multiple of the fundatmental frequency
$$f_1=440, f_2 = 2.440=880, f_3=3.440=1320$$
- *Inharmonicity* indicates a deviation from a harmonic partial
