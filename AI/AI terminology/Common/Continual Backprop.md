Continual [[backpropagation|backprop]]
### Continual Backprop
The algorithm that continually injects random features alongside gradient descent using a new generate-and-test process
Unlike [[backpropagation|backprop]], [[Continual Backprop]] is able to continually adapt in both supervised and [[RL|Reinforcement Learning]] probems. 
[[Continual Backprop]] using the advantages of random initializaion present throughout learning.
