### Deep Learning
Deep learning (DL) involves training [[NN|neural networks]], which in their original form consisted of a single layer (i.e., [[The Perceptron]]), so subsequent work explored the use of “deep” architectures, which added [[hidden layers]] between input and output (Rosenblatt, 1962; Minsky and Papert, 1969), a form of neural network that is commonly called the [[multi-layer perceptron (MLP)]], or [[DNN|Deep Neural Network]].
