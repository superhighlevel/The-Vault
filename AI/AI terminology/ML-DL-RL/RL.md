### Reinforcement Learning
![[Interaction between an RL agent and the external environment.png]]
##### Foundations
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm where an [[intelligent agents]] learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with an initially unknown environment.
As illustrated in Fig. 2.5, the agent-environment interaction is often modeled as a discrete-time ![[Markov decision process#Markov decision process]]

#### Other
While [[Supervised Learning|SL]] learns from *previous experiences* provided by a knowledgeable external supervisor, [[RL]] learns by *experiencing on its own*.
