Intent detection is usually approached as a [[supervised classification]] task, mapping the entire input sentence to an element of a finite set of classes.
#### Intent classification
Intent classification is a form of [[text classification]] where the text is a *single sentence* that comes from a spoken or written [[utterance]]. Intent detection is typically set up as a [[sentence classification]] problem. Intent classification differs from[[ classification tasks]] in other fields due to the nature of the data which are text sentences, coming from spoken language utterances. Beyond the semantic information within the words many approaches have been made to extend the feature set using internal (syntactic, word context) or external (meta-data, sentence context) information.
