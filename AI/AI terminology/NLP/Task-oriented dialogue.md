#### Task-oriented dialogue systems
Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to assist users to accomplish a task (e.g. booking a flight, making a restaurant reservation and playing a song) through dialogue in natural language, either in a spoken or written form. As in most of the current approaches, we assume a system involving a pipeline of components, where the user utterance is first processed by an [[Automatic Speech Recognition]] (ASR) module and then processed by a [[Natural Language Understanding]] (NLU) component, which *interprets the userâ€™s needs*. Then a [[Dialogue State Tracker]] (DST) accumulates the dialogue information as the conversation progresses and may query a domain knowledge base to obtain relevant data. A dialogue policy manager then decides what is the next action to be executed and a [[Natural Language Generation]] (NLG) component produces the actual response to the user.
