#### [[RL]] [[intelligent dialogue system]] 
The dialogue agent navigates in a MDP, interacting with its environment over a sequence of discrete steps. At each step, the agent observes the current state, and chooses an action according to a policy. The agent then receives a reward and observes a new state, continuing the cycle until the episode terminates. The goal of dialogue learning is to find optimal policies to maximize expected rewards. 
In [[RL intelligent dialogs system]] we need to optimize the [[CPS]] for a certain dialogue.

Although RL provides a unified ML framework for building dialogue agents, applying RL requires training the agents by interacting with ==real users==, which can be ==expensive== in many domains.
