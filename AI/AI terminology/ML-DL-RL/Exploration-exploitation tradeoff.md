#### Exploration-exploitation tradeoff
In RL, the agent needs to collect *reward* signals from the environment. This raises the question of which experimentation strategy results in more effective learning. The agent has to *exploit* what it already knows in order to obtain high rewards, while having to *explore* unknown states and actions in order to make better action selections in the future.
