### **Neural methods in [[NLP]] tasks**

- Neural methods in NLP tasks often consist of three steps:
	1. *[[Encoding (NLP)]]* symbolic user input and knowledge into their neural semantic representations, where semantically related or similar concepts are represented as vectors that are close to each other.
	2. *[[Reasoning (NLP)]]* in the neural space to generate a system response based on input and system state. 
	3. *[[Decoding (NLP)]]* the system response into a natural language output in a symbolic space

[[Encoding (NLP)]], [[Reasoning (NLP)]] and [[Decoding (NLP)]] are implemented using [[NN]] of different architectures, all of which may be stacked into a [[DNN]] trained in an end-to-end fashion via [[back propagation]].
